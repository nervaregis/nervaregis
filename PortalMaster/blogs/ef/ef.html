  <h2>Emerging Factions</h2>

<hr>
<p>Hello there everyone! It's time for another blog! Today we'll be going over the new factions in Aftermath. 
Due to the wish to keep things mostly vanilla and try to follow through with the time progression since we're trying to keep the amount of new factions somewhat low, however there are some cases where they are needed to fill a roleplay or gameplay niche. 
The two factions we'll be going over today are the Red Sails, a Bretonian based pirate faction and the Sons of Ymir, a Sigma / Omicron based unlawful group dedicated to going after the GMG and Corsairs.</p>





    <h4>Red Sails</h4>
<p>First up, the Red Sails. This is an emergent pirate group whose sole focus is on making money. 
The reason we decided to add this faction is because story-wise most of the houses have been heavily damaged following the Rheinland War, and though Bretonia was mostly spared there would still be enough turmoil to allow for the existence of such a group.
 They are not wealthy or particularly powerful, but this decentralized group is oriented towards pure piracy. They also fill a gameplay niche, with most other houses having a faction or organization that is heavily involved in the pirate trade. 
This isn't the case with Bretonia as both the Molly and Gaian factions have political motivations for being unlawful. By adding the Red Sails we help to allow players a pirate avenue without any political association.</p>

<p>This is Port Nassau, an asteroid base belonging to the Red Sails. Given their background as simple pirates and thus lacking the civilian
support of the Molly movement or the Gaians, the Red Sails are probably the least equipped Bretonian unlawful group.
 Unlike the other two groups though, the Red Sails are a purely profit oriented group and only tend to pick fights that they are sure they can win.</p>	
	
	
    <h4>Sons of Ymir</h4>	
<p>The second faction that we are adding is the Sons of Ymir, a group of loosely Rheinland supported individuals who attack the Corsairs in an attempt to steal Artifacts from them. 
Due to the routes that need to be taken for this along with the natural Rheinland bitterness towards the GMG the GMG themselves are also targets for the group. 
From the gameplay side of things, with Nomads and the Order being unplayable there aren't any Omicron / Sigma based unlawfuls aside from the Outcasts and the Corsairs. 
While we could add more life to the Omicrons by expanding the Corsair / Outcast presence there, these two factions already have a significant presence through the rest of Sirius. 
We won't be removing them from the Omicrons in any way, but we felt that a local faction might serve this purpose better.</p>

<p>Pictured above is Aruba Station, one of their bases that is located in the Omicron Theta system. 
The factions presence will mostly be along the Sigma - Omicron route and focus on traffic in that area for piracy targets. 
The station itself will serve as a base of operations in the region for them as well as storing artifacts which are in high demand in Rheinland.</p>


<h4> Going forward</h4>
<p>With the two new factions explained there is also a bit of new information regarding blogs. 
There has been a bit of radio silence on this front with real life getting in the way for a few departments in general along with an especially large undertaking with game physics. 
From here on out though we're hoping to get back to a normal schedule, although blog frequency will probably be a bit reduced from what it was before. 
With the extra downtime between updates there should however be an increase in overall blog size to go with this, so hopefully we'll be able to go into greater detail on the stuff we do talk about.
 We should have a big post from all the departments in a week or two to let everyone know what's been going on. That's all for now and I hope everyone has enjoyed learning about the new factions!</p>
